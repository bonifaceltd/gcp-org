- terraform service account

```
Apply complete! Resources: 40 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

bucket = bon-terraform-state
project = bon-terraform-007-fbf5
svc_account = org-terraform@bon-terraform-007-fbf5.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

## IAC

At this point terragrunt takes ownership
---

- deploy all folders + projects as depicted in diagram, and incorporate dependencies

- deploy all networking components

## CI/CD - Github Actions

`secrets.TF_GCP_SA_KEY` for svc account `org-terraform@bon-terraform-007-fbf5.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
`secrets.TOKEN` GitHub API token used to post comments to pull requests

current terragrunt actions does not support `run-all` commands - created a fork [bonifaceltd/terragrunt-github-actions](https://github.com/bonifaceltd/terragrunt-github-actions) to fix this 

## Networking

BGP IPs `169.254.XX.0`
ASN `645XX`

| Env | Transport | Squad-A | Squad-B | Squad-C |
|:---:|:---------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| DEV |     12    |    22   |    32   |    42   |
